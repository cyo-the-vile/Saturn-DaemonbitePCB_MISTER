Saturn-DaemonbitePCB_MISTER


Uses Authentic Saturn controller ports from a Sega Saturn along with MickGyver's Daemonbite firmware to use a Sega Saturn controller with MISTER FPGA. You will need an Arduino PRO micro.  


Take the ZIP file to your favorite fab house such as JLCPCB.  

V2 will likely have a version with cannibalized extension port cable connector.  Until suitable springs can be used on a card edge connector this will have to do.


Any other questions @ me on twitter.  @cyothevile


Soon I will have photo of it assembled.
